This project that will show college D1 basketball rankings on a website based off of a similar program by Mark G. Terwilliger and an algorithm made by Ray D. Theis.

Much of the python is getting the data using Selenium, I need to go back and update this to make it faster eventually, but it works for now.
The PHP mostly handles the logic behind the website.
The txt files are alot of the data I got from web scraping.
