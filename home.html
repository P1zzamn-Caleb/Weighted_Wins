<h2>NCAA Basketball</h2>

<p>This is the NCAA basketball version of Weighted Wins. The system was originally developed with college football in mind. Visit

<h2>Weighted Wins</h2>

<p>
The basic premise of "Weighted Wins" is one the average fan would readily accept.  All wins are not equal.  Defeating a highly successful team, one with a winning record, is more difficult than defeating an unsuccessful team, one with a losing record.  Therefore, the system assigns a <i>weight</i> to each opponent.  This weight is determined in a fair, unbiased, and systematic manner by considering a team's record and the records of its opponents.  After the weights are assigned, teams accumulate weighted wins and weighted losses.
</p>

<p>
Unlike the polls and some of the computers, "Weighted Wins" starts all teams from the same position.  Each team begins the season with 0.00 wins and a weight of 1.00.  (Since wins in all major sports count 1 win, the weight of 1.00 was chosen for the starting point.)  As the season develops, the weight of a team increases or decreases depending on whether the team wins or loses.  A weight of 1.20 would indicate a relatively strong team and a weight of .85 would indicate a much weaker team.  Weights usually range from a high of approximately 1.45 to a low of .55.
</p>

<p>
The value of a team's win is determined by its opponent's <i>weight</i>.  Losses are also weighted and determined in a consistent manner.
