<p><b>WEIGHTED WINS</b></p>

<p>The Weighted Wins for a given team is simply the accumulation of the Final Weights of it's opponents.  For example, if a team defeats an opponent with a Final Weight of 1.23, the winning team receives a Weighted Win of 1.23.  To defeat a team with a FW = .97, the winning team receives a Weighted Win of .97.</p>

<p><b>WEIGHTED LOSSES</b></p>

<p>To determine the weighted loss, two numerical values are needed.  The value of the loss is the Final Weight of the winning team minus the Initial Weight of the losing team (FW - IW). Teams that lose to quality opponents are not penalized as severely as losing to teams with losing records.  For example, a team with a 9-3 record (IW = 1.06) loses to a team with a FW of 1.17.  The Weighted Loss in this case is .11 (1.17 - 1.06 = .11).    The value .11 is the weighted loss and this value is added to the Weighted Wins total.  On the other hand, suppose that same 9-3 team loses to a team with a FW of .97.  In this example the Weighted Loss would be -.09. (.97 - 1.06 = -.09).  The Weighted Wins total would decrease by .09 since a negative value was obtained.  The following table illustrates the complete process.</p>

<p><b>Notes</b> on above illustration:  Oregon State had one win over a Non-Division 1-A opponent, so they had two more losses than wins against Division 1-A teams (hence, the -0.020 FW Adj). 
</p>

<p>
When calculating the Weighted Wins and Weighted Losses for Boise State, you first count the three losses and then add the 7 best wins for a total of 10 games. The two weakest wins (Idaho and Non-Division I-A) are dropped. See 
<b>WW Criteria</b> for more details.
